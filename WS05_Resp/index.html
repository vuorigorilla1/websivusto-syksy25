        Blaise Bailey Finnegan III is the name of an Iron Maiden vocalist and is
        also the name of the second track on Godspeed You Black Emperor!'s EP,
        Slow Riot For New Zero Kanada. The track takes the form of an interview with
        Mr. Finnegan. Note that the poem at the end of the interview is in fact
        the lyrics from the Iron Maiden song Virus. Interviewer: Well... Where
        are you coming from? Blaise Bailey Finnegan III: (pause) Well... I don't
        like the way the country's ran, don't you know, and, erm... that's
        pretty much what i was expressing in my poem. The government... the
        American government - they're sneaky, they're very deceitful, they're
        liars, they're cheats, they're rip-offs. I mean, the American government
        is one systematic government that...that nobody can trust. I don't trust
        them myself. Interviewer: And how long have you been writing for? Blaise
        Bailey Finnegan III: Huh? Interviewer: How long have you been writing
        for? Blaise Bailey Finnegan III: Since I was four. Interviewer: Do you
        do this sort of thing a lot, like, open-mic kinda questions? Blaise
        Bailey Finnegan III: Oh, I love open-mics, I love coming here to do
        open-mics, absolutely. Interviewer: What kind of reactions do you
        usually get? Blaise Bailey Finnegan III: Usually, people are... are
        pretty much in agreement with what I'm saying. Interviewer: We overheard
        you before talking about... you went to court today for a speeding
        ticket? Blaise Bailey Finnegan III: That's accurate. Interviewer: right.
        Do you wanna tell us that story? Blaise Bailey Finnegan III: Yes,
        absolutely, I wouldn't mind telling you the story. Erm... I went to
        court today for a speeding ticket, and I told the judge, erm... "Let me
        tell you something, and you listen and you listen good, I'm only gonna
        say this one time and one time only, I don't repeat myself for nobody, "
        I said. I says... "I'm here to pay a speeding ticket, not to listen to
        your lectures and hear you run your mouth for an hour." I says "I'm here
        to pay off my speeding ticket ...and I'm here to get my fines out of the
        way and get the fuck to work." The judge says "You can't talk like that
        in my courtroom, you're in contempt of court." then I said... I told the
        judge, "If that's the best you can do, I feel sorry for you." I said
        "Why don't you just shut your fucking mouth for once and listen." I said
        "I'm not gonna take any shit." I said "I'm gonna pay my speeding ticket
        like I said." I walked up to the god damn judge and I hand him my 25
        dollars and I says "Here's my money, now I am leaving." And I left it at
        that. Then, before I left, I turned around and told the judge "I'm here
        to state who I am and be honest with you." I said "If they thought I was
        dangerous on the road like you're trying to accuse me of, wouldn't they
        have taken my license when I first got it? Yes they would." And the
        judge says "Yeah, you have a point, " He goes "You don't need to get
        loud, " I said "Don't get loud?" I says "I've got every right to get
        loud." I says "You can't do a god damn thing about it, because I'm
        expressing myself in your court, and there is nothing you can do about
        it. You think you're god because you have a robe and you can put people
        up the goddamn river for 20 years? Well you're not." And I left it at
        that. Interviewer: Did you walk away? Blaise Bailey Finnegan III: Yes I
        did... I don't like the judicial system, I don't like the government
        system, I don't like the police, I don't like anything to do with this
        country's government. I just don't like it, because... they're sneaky,
        like I said - they're deceitful, they're lying, they're cheats, they rip
        people off. That's the American government for you. America is a third
        world country, and people don't recognise it... and I think that that's
        pretty god damn sad, that they don't recognise their own country as a
        third world, third rate, third class slum. Interviewer: Well... Do you
        have any weapons? Blaise Bailey Finnegan III: Yes, I do. I own a
        high-powered assault rifle, I own a 12-gauge double barrel shotgun, I
        own a regular shotgun, I own a regular hunting rifle, I own a 9mm, a
        357, a 45 handgun, a 38 special, and, erm... I own an m-16 fully
        automatic ground assault rifle... Interviewer: Do you think things are
        gonna get better before they get worse? Blaise Bailey Finnegan III: No
        way. Things are just gonna get worse and keep on getting worse. Like I
        said, America's a third world country as it is and... and we're just
        basically in a hopeless situation as it stands. Interviewer: What do you
        think this country's gonna look like in the year 2003? Blaise Bailey
        Finnegan III: Y'know, I'll tell you the truth - nothing against you
        guys, but I don't wanna answer that question because... I haven't even
        got a mind that's that...that inhumane. Interviewer: are you ready for
        what's coming? Blaise Bailey Finnegan III: Ready as I'll ever be. Most
        people aren't. There's a little saying... Dates back for generations...
        Interviewer: Go on... Blaise Bailey Finnegan III: Be prepared for
        anything at any time from anybody, don't take no shit, always stand your
        ground. People wanna come up to me and run their mouth - guess what?
        I'll throw them through the fucking window... I won't think a thing of
        it. Interviewer: Would you mind reciting your poem for us? Blaise Bailey
        Finnegan III: Not at all, I don't see why... I don't see why I couldn't.
        There's an evil virus that's threatening mankind It's not state of the
        art, it's a serious state of the mind The muggers, the backstabbers, the
        two faced elite A menace to society, a social disease To brainwash the
        mind is a social disorder The cynics, the apathy one-upmanship order
        Watching beginnings of social decay Gloating and sneering at life's
        disarray Eating away at your own self esteem Pouncing on every word that
        you might be saying To attack someone's mind is a social disorder The
        constitution, the government, martial law order Superficially smiling a
        shake of the hand As soon as your back is turned treason is planned When
        every good thing's laid to rest By the governments hate, by the
        constitution and their lies And every time you think you're safe And
        when you go to turn away You know they're sharpening all their knives
        All in your mind All in your head Try to relate it All in your mind All
        in your head Try to escape it Without a conscience they destroy And
        that's a thing that they enjoy They're a sickness that's in all of our
        minds They want to sink the ship and leave The way they laugh at you and
        me You know it happens all the time But it only happens in your mind The
        rats in the cellar you know who you are... Or do you? Watching
        beginnings of social decay... Interviewer: Thank you for your time.
